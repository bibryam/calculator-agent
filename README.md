# Dapr Agents Calculator Demo

This project demonstrates an issue with the Dapr Agents framework where the LLMOrchestrator service never stops and continuously shows an error message:

```
failed to invoke scheduled actor reminder named: run-activity due to: failed to invoke 'AddWorkflowEvent' method on workflow actor: error from worfklow actor: no such instance exists
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Dapr CLI (v1.15.x)
- Redis (for state storage and pub/sub)
- Azure OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment 
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure your Azure OpenAI credentials in the `.env` file:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your-azure-deployment-name
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-01-01-preview
```

## Running the Application

Make sure Redis is running on your local machine (default port 6379).

### Running All Components with Dapr

1. Start the calculator agent:

```bash
dapr run --app-id CalculatorApp --app-port 8002 --resources-path ./components python calculator_agent.py
```

2. In a separate terminal, start the LLM orchestrator:

```bash
dapr run --app-id OrchestratorApp --app-port 8004 --resources-path ./components python llm_orchestrator.py
```

3. In a third terminal, run the client with Dapr:

```bash
dapr run --app-id ClientApp --resources-path ./components python client.py
```

### Alternative Sidecar Configuration

If you prefer to specify HTTP ports explicitly:

1. Start the calculator agent:

```bash
dapr run --app-id CalculatorApp --app-port 8002 --dapr-http-port 3500 --resources-path ./components -- python calculator_agent.py
```

2. Start the LLM orchestrator:

```bash
dapr run --app-id OrchestratorApp --app-port 8004 --dapr-http-port 3501 --resources-path ./components -- python llm_orchestrator.py
```

3. Run the client:

```bash
dapr run --app-id ClientApp --dapr-http-port 3502 --resources-path ./components -- python client.py
```

## Reproducing the Error

The error occurs after the orchestrator finishes processing the calculation ("What is 1 + 1?"). Even though the workflow completes successfully, the orchestrator continues running and repeatedly shows the error:

```
WARN: execution failed with a recoverable error and will be retried later: failed to invoke 'AddWorkflowEvent' method on workflow actor: error from worfklow actor: no such instance exists
ERRO: failed to invoke scheduled actor reminder named: run-activity due to: failed to invoke 'AddWorkflowEvent' method on workflow actor: error from worfklow actor: no such instance exists
```

### Expected Behavior

The orchestrator should cleanly complete the workflow without continuous retry attempts after the workflow has ended.

### Actual Behavior

The orchestrator keeps trying to execute an activity for a workflow instance that no longer exists.

## Troubleshooting

If you can't see the error right away, check that:

1. All three services (calculator agent, orchestrator, and client) are running
2. The client successfully sent the message (you should see "âœ… Successfully published request" in the client terminal)
3. Watch the logs in the orchestrator terminal for the error message
